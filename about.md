I try to write about what I already know and what I’m currently learning about [this damn industry](https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/this-damn-industry--net-17054){:target="_blank"}. Outside programming, I try to [make art](https://kennyalmendral.artstation.com/){:target="_blank"}, [compose music](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0x4uUmIIwlvugj7YtZK2yG){:target="_blank"}, [do music arrangements](https://soundcloud.com/kennyalmendral){:target="_blank"} and [record programming videos, play guitar, bass, piano/keyboard covers](https://www.youtube.com/kennyalmendral){:target="_blank"} if I find the time.

It is very likely that I’ll make mistakes in my posts, so feel free to correct me if I’m wrong.
